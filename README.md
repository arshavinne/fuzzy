# MultiLang Algo

MultiLang Algo is a collection of code scribbles by Wahit Fitriyanto. It contains various snippets of code in different languages and frameworks, such as Python, Java, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, and more. The purpose of this project is to showcase some of the interesting and creative things that can be done with code.

## Installation

To run the code scribbles, you will need to have the appropriate tools and libraries installed on your machine. For example, to run the Python code, you will need to have Python 3 and the required modules installed. You can use the `requirements.txt` file to install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Similarly, for other languages and frameworks, you will need to follow the respective installation guides and documentation.

## Usage

Each code scribble is located in a separate folder with a descriptive name. For example, the folder `python/ascii_art` contains a Python script that generates ASCII art from an image. To run the script, you can use the following command:

```bash
python ascii_art.py image.jpg
```

The script will output the ASCII art to the console. You can also save the output to a text file using redirection:

```bash
python ascii_art.py image.jpg > output.txt
```

You can explore the other code scribbles in a similar way. Each folder has a `README.md` file that explains what the code does and how to use it.

## Contributing

This project is open for contributions. If you have any ideas or suggestions for new code scribbles, feel free to create an issue or a pull request. You can also fork this repository and add your own code scribbles.
