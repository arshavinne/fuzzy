# MultiLang-Algo

This is a personal project where I collect and share some of the sample code, scribbles, and algorithms that I have learned from various programming languages. I hope this repo can be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about different programming paradigms and techniques.

## Languages

The languages that I have used in this repo are:

- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- PHP

## Topics

The topics that I have covered in this repo are:

- Data structures
- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Graph algorithms
- Dynamic programming
